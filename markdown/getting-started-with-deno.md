## Deno

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a new JavaScript runtime built on [V8](https://github.com/v8/v8#readme).

Deno uses [ESM](/migrating-from-cjs-to-esm) to load JavaScript modules, and natively supports browser APIs like [fetch()](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/web_platform_apis). Together with its [permissions](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions), this makes Deno feel more like a scriptable web client, and less like a tool for building web servers.

The Deno executable is built in Rust. While this may seem like an implementation detail, you could also describe Deno as a tool to embed JavaScript inside Rust programs.

This article describes my first steps using Deno.

## Getting Started

Deno can be [installed](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) by copying the release from [GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/latest) to a location on your path. I configured my environment as follows:

```sh
export DENO_DIR=~/deno
export PATH=${PATH}:${DENO_DIR}/bin
```

Once installed, 'deno --version' shows the installed version and 'deno upgrade' upgrades the binary to the latest release. 'deno help' shows usage for other commands.

I recommend installing the Deno [VS Code extension](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno#readme) for IDE support and debugging. The [manual](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/debugging_your_code#vscode) suggested a [launch config](https://github.com/jldec/deno-hello/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json), which works for me, _most_ of the time.

## hello.js

Here is [hello.js](https://github.com/jldec/deno-hello/tree/main/hello.js), my first Deno program. You can run it with `deno run hello.js args...`

```js
const hello = "Hello Deno";
console.log(`${hello} %s hello %o`, new Date(), Deno.args);

const buf = new TextEncoder().encode("-🦀-\n");
await Deno.stdout.write(buf);
console.table(buf);
```

The easiest way to write to stdout is by using the built-in console.log().

For those curious about Deno internals:

- The global `console` object is created in [runtime/js/99_main.js](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.7.5/runtime/js/99_main.js#L246).
- The `console.log()` method lives in [runtime/js/02_console.js](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.7.5/runtime/js/02_console.js#L1503).
- This calls the rust function `core.print` in [core/bindings.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.7.5/core/bindings.rs#L277).

[Deno.stdout]() provides a lower level stream interface. Notice the `await` on the promise returned by 'Deno.stdout.write()'.

### Typescript

The code above is also valid [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Since Deno includes a built-in TypeScript compiler, you could simply rename hello.js to hello.ts and it would work the same way.

The Deno [Standard Library](https://deno.land/std) is largely written in TypeScript, as are the declarations (and auto-generated docs) for [built-ins](https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable), so it helps to know a little TypeScript syntax even if you prefer to write JavaScript.

I find the TypeScript declarations most useful for code completion in VS Code.

## scan.js

In the spirit of leveraging Deno as a web client, I decided to try building a simple link validator. This requires a 3rd-party library to parse HTML.

I started my search assuming that a popular npm module would be my best bet, even if it wasn't available (yet) in [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) which is where library authors can register their GitHub repos to publish deno-compatible ESM modules.

After some googling, I landed on [parse5](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5) which enjoys wide usage and offers a simple, low-level tree API at its core.

I had also heard about [Skypack](https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/code/deno), a CDN, specifically designed to serve npm packages as ESM modules. A quick search on [skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/) and I had a URL for the parse5 module which works in Deno.

The code in [scan.js](https://github.com/jldec/deno-hello/blob/main/scan.js) crawls a website, validating that all the links on the site which point to the same origin can be fetched.

```js
import parse5 from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/parse5?dts";

const rootUrl = Deno.args[0];
if (!rootUrl) exit(1, "Please provide a URL");

const rootOrigin = new URL(rootUrl).origin;

const urlMap = {}; // tracks visited urls

await checkUrl(rootUrl);
const result = Object.entries(urlMap).filter((kv) => kv[1] !== "OK");

if (result.length) {
  exit(1, result);
} else {
  exit(0, "🎉 no broken links found.");
}

// recursively checks url and same-origin urls inside
// resolves when done
async function checkUrl(url, base) {
  base = base || url;
  try {
    // parse the url relative to base
    const urlObj = new URL(url, base);

    // ignore query params and hash
    const href = urlObj.origin + urlObj.pathname;

    // only process same-origin urls
    if (!urlMap[href] && urlObj.origin === rootOrigin) {
      // fetch from href
      urlMap[href] = "pending";
      const res = await fetch(href);

      // bail out if fetch was not ok
      if (!res.ok) {
        urlMap[href] = { status: res.status, in: base };
        return;
      }

      urlMap[href] = "OK";

      // parse response
      console.log("parsing", urlObj.pathname);
      const html = await res.text();
      const document = parse5.parse(html);

      // scan for <a> tags and call checkURL for each href
      const promises = [];
      scan(document, "a", (node) => {
        promises.push(checkUrl(attr(node, "href"), href));
      });
      await Promise.all(promises);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    urlMap[url] = { error: err.message, in: base };
  }
}

// return value of attr with name for a node
function attr(node, name) {
  return node.attrs.find((attr) => attr.name === name)?.value;
}

// recursive DOM scan
// calls fn(node) on nodes matching tagName
function scan(node, tagName, fn) {
  if (node?.tagName === tagName) {
    fn(node);
  }
  if (!node.childNodes) return;
  for (const childNode of node.childNodes) {
    scan(childNode, tagName, fn);
  }
}

function exit(code, msg) {
  console.log(msg);
  Deno.exit(code);
}
```

To run the script, call `deno run --allow-net scan.js URL`. E.g.

```sh
$ deno run --allow-net scan.js https://jldec.me
parsing /
parsing /getting-started-with-deno
parsing /first-steps-using-cloudflare-pages
parsing /calling-rust-from-a-cloudflare-worker
parsing /a-web-for-everyone
parsing /why-serverless-at-the-edge
parsing /fun-with-vercel
parsing /migrating-from-cjs-to-esm
parsing /forays-from-node-to-rust
parsing /about
parsing /github-actions-101
parsing /spring-boot-101
parsing /why-the-web-needs-better-html-editing-components
🎉 no broken links found.
```

NOTE: For this first implementation, there is no queueing, so I would not recommend pointing it at large site.

## Compiling

The deno experience still feels a little rough in places, but one new feature which I really like, is the ability to [compile](https://deno.land/manual/tools/compiler) a script into a self-contained executable.

```sh
$ deno --unstable compile --allow-net scan.js
Bundle file:./scan.js
Compile file:./scan.js
Emit scan
```

Now I can call `scan` without having to install Deno or remember any special options.

```sh
$ ./scan
Please provide a URL

$ ./scan https://jldec.fun
...
🎉 no broken links found.
```
