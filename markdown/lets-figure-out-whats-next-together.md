## News

It took less than a second for the news to sink in.  The notification flashed, I saw the words "difficult news" and "you're affected". I was amongst 21 people let go. 

That was yesterday.

> So, what's next?

To be honest, I don't know what's next (yet).

- I've built software up and down the stack, with a focus on simplicity and user-experience.

- I'm a highly technical EM/PM leader.

- I enjoy shipping stuff, working with diverse people - especially creative engineers and designers. 

- I excel at discovering how to shape new technologies into products that customers get excited about.
